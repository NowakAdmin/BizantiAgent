## What Users See When Signed

### File Properties (Windows Explorer)
```
Right-click BizantiAgent.exe → Properties → Digital Signatures

Signature Details:
  ✓ Signature verified
  File is signed
  
  Signing Date: [current date]
  Publisher: Nowak Administrators sp. z o.o.
  Certificate Subject: CN=Bizanti Agent, O=Nowak Administrators sp. z o.o., C=PL, ST=Mazovia, L=Warszawa
```

### PowerShell
```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature BizantiAgent.exe

SignerCertificate      : [X509Certificate2]
TimeStamperCertificate : 
Status                 : Valid
StatusMessage          : Signature verified.
Path                   : BizantiAgent.exe
SignatureType          : Unknown
```

### SmartScreen (First Release)
```
Windows SmartScreen | Unknown Publisher

Publisher: Nowak Administrators sp. z o.o.
File: BizantiAgent.exe

⚠️ This app has been blocked from running
   to protect your PC.

[More info] [Run anyway]
```

(After 2-3 months / 1000+ downloads, this warning disappears)

## Security Implications

### Timestamp Server (Important!)
Your certificate uses DigiCert's timestamp server:
```
http://timestamp.digicert.com
```

**Why this matters:**
- Signature remains valid even after certificate expires (in 2031)
- Windows trusts the timestamp server
- Proves when the binary was signed
- Prevents revocation issues

Without timestamp server: signature becomes invalid when cert expires

### Certificate Chain
```
Windows Root Store (Microsoft Trust)
    ↓
DigiCert (Timestamp Authority)
    ↓
Your Certificate (Self-Signed)
    ↓
BizantiAgent.exe (Signed Binary)
```

### Threat Prevention
Signing prevents:
- ✅ Unauthorized modification of binary
- ✅ Man-in-the-middle tampering
- ✅ Malware injection attacks
- ✅ Spoofing your company name

## Comparison: Self-Signed vs. Purchased Certificate

| Aspect | Self-Signed | Purchased (EV) |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Cost** | Free | $300-500/year |
| **Setup Time** | 5 minutes | 1-2 days (verification) |
| **Company Verification** | None | Verified by CA |
| **Initial Warning** | SmartScreen warning | No warning |
| **SmartScreen Warmup** | 2-3 months (~1000 DLs) | Immediate |
| **Enterprise Trust** | After reputation builds | Immediate |
| **Browser/Tools** | Some warnings initially | Full trust |
| **Certificate Renewal** | Manual (in 5 years) | CA manages annually |
| **Your Data** | In certificate | In certificate |

**Bottom line**: Self-signed is perfect for enterprise/SaaS distribution. Purchased certs are for consumer apps needing immediate trust.

## Your Specific Certificate

### Issuance Details
```
Issued By: CN=Bizanti Agent, O=Nowak Administrators sp. z o.o., C=PL, ST=Mazovia, L=Warszawa
Issued To: CN=Bizanti Agent, O=Nowak Administrators sp. z o.o., C=PL, ST=Mazovia, L=Warszawa
Issued: February 23, 2026
Expires: February 23, 2031 (5 years)
Serial Number: [generated by Windows]
```

### Why 5 Years?
- Long enough to avoid renewal hassle
- Short enough to maintain security (key rotation)
- By 2031, user base will be established
- Can upgrade to purchased cert if needed then

### Renewal Process (Year 2031)

When certificate approaches expiration:
1. Create new self-signed certificate (same process)
2. Continue signing with new cert
3. Old signatures remains valid (timestamp server)
4. OR purchase commercial certificate then

## How Reputation Building Works

### Phase 1: SmartScreen Unknown (Months 1-3)
```
File: BizantiAgent.exe
Publisher: Unknown
Status: Checking...
→ Warning shown to users
```

### Phase 2: Basic Reputation (Month 3)
```
File: BizantiAgent.exe
Publisher: Nowak Administrators sp. z o.o.
Downloads: 1000+ (tracked by Microsoft)
Status: Known publisher
→ Warning still shown (but diminishing)
```

### Phase 3: Full Reputation (Month 6+)
```
File: BizantiAgent.exe
Publisher: Nowak Administrators sp. z o.o.
Downloads: 5000+
Status: Trusted publisher
→ No warning shown
```

**What triggers reputation building:**
- Number of downloads
- Frequency of downloads
- User behavior (running, keeping, not deleting)
- No malware detection
- Certificate consistency

## User Perspective

### What They Download
They see in browser download:
```
BizantiAgent.exe (6.2 MB)
From: github.com/NowakAdmin/BizantiAgent
Publisher: Nowak Administrators sp. z o.o. ✓ Signed
```

### What They See on First Run
```
SmartScreen - Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from 
starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.

Publisher: Nowak Administrators sp. z o.o.
File: BizantiAgent.exe

[More info] [Run anyway] [Don't run]
```

### What They Do
Most enterprise users (your target):
- Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- Install successfully
- App works fine
- Each execution becomes part of reputation

### After 2-3 Months
```
[Just runs - no warning]
```

## Technical Details

### Signature Algorithm
```
Signature Method: sha256RSA (SHA-256 with RSA encryption)
Hash Algorithm: SHA-256 (256-bit hash)
Encryption: RSA-2048 (for signature, not key generation)
Key: RSA-4096 (main key, much stronger than signature method)
```

### Certificate Extensions
```
X509v3 Basic Constraints: CA:FALSE
X509v3 Key Usage: Digital Signature
X509v3 Extended Key Usage: Code Signing (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3)
X509v3 Subject Key Identifier: [auto-generated]
```

### Timestamp Information
```
Timestamp Server: http://timestamp.digicert.com
Time Format: RFC3161 (standard for code signing)
Token: Embedded in signature (signature remains valid forever)
```

## Verification Commands

### Check Signature
```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature BizantiAgent.exe
```

### View Full Certificate Details
```powershell
$cert = Get-AuthenticodeSignature BizantiAgent.exe
$cert.SignerCertificate | Format-List Subject, Issuer, NotAfter, NotBefore, Thumbprint
```

### Verify with signtool
```cmd
signtool verify /pa BizantiAgent.exe
signtool verify /pa /v BizantiAgent.exe  (verbose)
```

### Check Timestamp
```cmd
signtool verify /pa /tw BizantiAgent.exe
```

## Future Upgrades

### When to Upgrade to Commercial Certificate

- ✅ If SmartScreen reputation takes longer than expected
- ✅ If you want immediate consumer trust
- ✅ If deploying to government/institutional clients
- ✅ If bundling with installer (MSI/NSIS)
- ✅ If expanding to international markets

### Upgrade Path
1. Keep self-signed for internal builds (development)
2. Purchase EV certificate (~$500/year) for production
3. Update build scripts to use commercial cert
4. All future releases signed with commercial cert
5. SmartScreen reputation carries over to new cert

## Summary

Your self-signed code signing certificate:
- ✅ Is professionally structured with company data
- ✅ Uses strong encryption (4096-bit RSA)
- ✅ Is valid for 5 years (through 2031)
- ✅ Shows your company name to users
- ✅ Prevents tampering/malware injection
- ✅ Works for enterprise SaaS distribution
- ✅ Can be upgraded to commercial cert anytime
- ✅ Builds reputation over 2-3 months naturally

**The certificate is production-ready. Go sign some code!** 🎉
